# KNN_for_mixed_data
The KNeighborsClassifier of sklearn package rests mainly on Euclidian distance and some other metrics that are suitable only to quantify the similarity between two observations for numerical variables, and for the categorical ones. So, our purpose is to find out how to exploit these metrics on a mixed data so that we can apply the KNN algorithm. We apply the Multiple correspondence analysis on only categorical data, we subset from them 85% of information, and transform it to a numerical data, that are the coordinates of each observation on 30 components. This approach has achieved an accuracy of 91% on test data.
