# KNN-for-mixed-data
The KNeighborsClassifier of sklearn package rests mainly on Euclidian distance and some other metrics that are suitable only to quantify the similarity between two observations for numerical variables, and for the categorical ones. So our purpose is to find out how to exploit these metrics on a mixed data so that we can apply the KNN algorithm.
